# Scan2ClipBoard 

Scan2ClipBoard is an android app which recognizes characters from an image and stores them to the clipboard. 
It uses Google's Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the characters
and displays them in a list where you can choose which ones you want to store to the clipboard. 
After that the application closes automatically.
